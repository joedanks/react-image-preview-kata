# react-image-preview-tutorial
A Kata for creating an image preview tool in react.

The base project was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which comes bundled with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react).  I have a sample test to show how Jest can be used.

The goal is to create an image preview tool using React
Here are the requirements
* Allow a user to upload an image file
* Display the file on the screeen

If you're feeling up to it, try to TDD a solution.
If you need help there should be a branch with one possible solution.
